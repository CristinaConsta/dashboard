# Introduction

The assessment dashboard application is meant to deliver a solution for a problem that I have discovered with the Solent university portal. It is about checking the assesments dates and grades in a single application and at any point we want to, because at the present moment the students need to work with two different applications and with missing elements in both of them. For the dashboard, we cannot filter by year of study, for example, and in the final grades application, there is no data for the past years and for the current year there will be available between the final marking and the start of the new year. Gathering data from other students, using surveys, I found out that there are more issues to address, such as filtering and sorting the assessments, or to see the learning evolution over the years of study.
The application is designed for the Solent university students only and accesing the dashboard and the chart is constrained by the login. Being a university application, highly secured, the users are created by the admin and my application must use the users provided. There is no registration, only login into the application, with the users defined for the Firebase database to authenticate, as provided below:

[email, password]
`dashboard@email.com, dashboard12345`
`student1@email.com, student11111`
